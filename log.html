    <p>Worked on a tiered battery combining cells in parallel and series. The experiment was a partial success. Voltage increased as expected with added layers, however current decreased slightly. I suspect the parallel stacking is not effective electrochemically, though it may still be worth pursuing for visual effect.</p>
	<p>Worked on repairing the dissected dog toy. Discovered I was missing several crucial parts so it is not salvageable without 3D printing or otherwise obtaining the missing pieces. The cost would not be worth the effort.</p>
	<p>Looking into cheap stepper motors as a possible alternative.</p>
