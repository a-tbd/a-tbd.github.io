    <p>A single red LED flickers dimly, balanced between two figures that lean towards one another.  The figures are made of stacked copper, zinc, and blood gelatin disks of decreasing diameter.  The figures sit on a copper plate which reflects the scene above, while also linking the two figures electrically.</p> 
    <p>Family and blood are synonymous in many cultures.  In Family Portrait, blood ties are made explicit in the electrically closed system.  The blood gelatin acts as a conduit, facilitating the movement of electrons through the metal disks, and the two seemingly independent figures are connected via the LED above and the copper plate below.</p>
    <p>Like the invisible - and perhaps tenuous - connection of blood ties, the invisible and circular movement of electrons is only visible via the faint light of the LED.</p>
