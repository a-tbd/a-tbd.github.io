    <br>
    <!--p>Family and blood are synonymous in many cultures.  In this series of family photos, a single red LED makes visible the blood ties connecting the various figures.  Like the invisible - and perhaps tenuous - connection of blood or family ties, the invisible and circular movement of electrons is only visible via the faint light of the LED.</p>
    <p>In <i>Family Portrait</i>, the LED sits balanced atop two figures that lean towards one another.  The figures are made of stacked copper, zinc, and blood gelatin disks of decreasing diameter.  The figures sit on a copper plate which reflects the scene above, while also linking the two figures electrically.</p> 
    <p>Blood ties are made explicit through the electrically closed system.  The blood gelatin acts as a conduit, facilitating the movement of electrons through the metal disks, and the two seemingly independent figures are connected via the LED above and the copper plate below.</p>
    <p>In <i>Solitary Figure</i>, the LED protrudes sideways from the stacked zinc, copper, and geletin disks.  The light flickers dimly as the single family member barely generates enough energy to keep it lit.</p-->
